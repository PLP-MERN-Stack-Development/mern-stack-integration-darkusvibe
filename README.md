Project Overview

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) blog application that demonstrates seamless integration between a backend API and a modern frontend. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, provides RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts, while MongoDB (via Mongoose) stores the post data. The frontend is built with React and Vite, featuring dynamic components that fetch and display posts in real time, including loading and error handling states. The application allows users to view all posts, see individual post details, and eventually create new posts through the frontend interface. The project emphasizes clean code structure, environment variable management, and proper client-server communication, making it a complete example of a beginner-friendly full-stack application.
